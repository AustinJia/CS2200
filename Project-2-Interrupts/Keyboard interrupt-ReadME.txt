When program is running, click on keyboard device, type something fast
please do not type again before all stuff save to the EEEEE0 address and keyboard device is clear. 
My way to store things from the keyboard device to Memory is really slow, set the frequency to like 2k or 4.1k Hz when store character. 

Sometime will have sort of “unknown”  error.  >_<
just reset the program.
